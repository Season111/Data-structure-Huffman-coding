Lanzhou University School Song
The young people in the northwest should not delay any longer, cutting off our gowns and leaving our romance behind. The mission of the great era is imminent.
Striding out of Tongguan, watching a cloud of beacon smoke. How can you sweep away the fierce flames only with the tip of your tongue?
The young people of Gansu must not delay any longer, smashing our corolla to stop our singing feast. The burden of the great era is squeezed on both shoulders. Riding the long wind to rush to the blue sky, looking at the raging waves of the world.
